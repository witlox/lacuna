# FOSSA Configuration for Lacuna
# https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli/blob/master/docs/references/files/fossa-yml.md
#
# Lacuna is an Apache 2.0 licensed Python library.
# Python packages are dynamically linked/imported at runtime, not statically linked.

version: 3

# Path filtering - exclude test and development directories
paths:
  exclude:
    - tests
    - htmlcov
    - docs

# Vendored dependencies - false positives from bundled components
# These packages have permissive licenses but FOSSA detects GPL from bundled
# system libraries (BLAS/LAPACK, GCC runtime, etc.) that are dynamically linked
vendored-dependencies:
  # numpy: BSD-3-Clause - GPL flags from bundled BLAS/LAPACK headers
  - name: numpy
    version: "*"
  # scipy: BSD-3-Clause - GPL flags from bundled Fortran/BLAS components
  - name: scipy
    version: "*"
  # torch: BSD-3-Clause - GPL flags from bundled GCC runtime
  - name: torch
    version: "*"
  # ruff: MIT - GPL flags from tree-sitter grammars (not linked)
  - name: ruff
    version: "*"
  # setuptools: MIT - GPL flags from pkg_resources vendored code
  - name: setuptools
    version: "*"

# Notes on license compliance:
#
# Some dependencies may flag GPL/LGPL licenses from bundled components:
# - numpy: BSD-3-Clause (GPL flags from bundled BLAS/LAPACK)
# - torch: BSD-3-Clause (GPL flags from bundled GCC runtime)
# - scipy: BSD-3-Clause (GPL flags from bundled Fortran libraries)
# - presidio-*: MIT (Microsoft projects)
# - psycopg2-binary: LGPL-3.0 (dynamic linking is compliant)
#
# LGPL dependencies (like psycopg2-binary):
#   - LGPL allows dynamic linking without source disclosure
#   - Python imports are dynamic linking, not static
#   - This is compliant with Apache 2.0 distribution
